Accountability for deeds is a fundamental component of religion and protects Man from materialism, which is the starting point of greed. ‘Garden’ is the metaphor for the peace of mind obtained from true Aiman.",

In view of this the detailed description of the Holy Qur’an and other religious literature of the procedures of accountability on the Day of Judgment do not mean that God would be collecting evidence to prove the evil deeds of a particular person.

This is technically known as Fana fi Allah (the mystic experience of losing one's self in God) followed by Baqa Billah (the mystic experience of subsisting or living in or by God). These concepts are not easy to grasp and need guidance from a competent guide.",
